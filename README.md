# jQuery-Registration-Form.
I created a jQuery Registration Form. It has a registration list below it where the list is being saved. Furthermore, the entered data is being saved in the local storage even after the page refresher. This form has three fields name, email and city. It also posses the delete button and delete all button , in order to remove the whole list.
